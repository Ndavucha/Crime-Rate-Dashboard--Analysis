# Crime-Rate-Dashboard--Analysis

This is a simple crime rate analysis using Tableau.

### Research Questions

1. Which city has the most crime rates?
2. Which type of crime is common ?

### Findings
As can be observed burglary appears to be at the top as the most reported crime. The consistency of the results for the variable of burglary suggests that it is a common issue in the Miami area regardless of the sample size. Theft-All Other is also present in the sample as well as in the larger data set, which means that the crime type is another frequently recorded in the region. The use of random samples makes it relatively easy to understand the findings of the research, acting as a representation of the larger population. It enables the analysts to make general conclusions on tendencies and patterns. In crime analysis, using sampling to determine common types of crimes present would assist law enforcement in the efficient and proper distribution of assets and formulation of adequate measures.
